## Traffic violation detection in traffic video using  deep learning
This study presents a deep learning-based approach for predicting traffic violation events in traffic videos. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the proposed model analyzes video footage to identify and predict instances of traffic violations. The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning in enhancing traffic surveillance and enforcement strategies.

### Implementation - 
Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
  Collect diverse traffic videos, label violations, split dataset, resize videos, and normalize pixel values.

Step 2: Model Development
 Design CNN architecture, configure layers, train with SGD/Adam, experiment with hyperparameters, and improve model performance.

Step 3: Evaluation and Performance Metrics
 Evaluate on validation/testing sets, measure accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, use cross-validation, and ensure robust evaluation.

Step 4: Deployment and Real-Time Prediction
 Deploy for real-time prediction, integrate with video processing system, apply to frames/segments, and enhance accuracy with post-processing techniques.

### Dataset details - 
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a large collection of traffic video recordings, labeled with different types of traffic violation events.
A sizable object detection, segmentation, key-point detection, and captioning dataset is the MS COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset through the use of YOLO architecture. This dataset contains photos in its collection. It is now the most widely used object detection dataset.

### Results - 
The performance metrics for this project  includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify and classify objects in the traffic video with an averaged accuracy rate of 97%, it can also used to identify traffic violations in videos. High accuracy indicates overall correctness, precision measures the proportion of true positives, recall captures the proportion of actual positives identified, and F1-score balances precision and recall for a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.
